# Tucker Decomposition

## Overview
Tucker decomposition, also known as Tucker3 decomposition or N-mode SVD, is a form of higher-order singular value decomposition (SVD). It decomposes a tensor into a core tensor multiplied (or transformed) by a matrix along each mode (dimension). This method is particularly useful for dimensionality reduction and can be applied to various fields, including deep learning for optimizing convolutional layers.

## Application to Convolutional Layers
In the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Tucker decomposition can be used to decompose the weight tensor of a convolutional layer. This helps in reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity, making the model more efficient.

### Steps for Tucker Decomposition of a Convolutional Layer
1. **Extract the Weight Tensor**: Get the weight tensor from the convolutional layer.
2. **Apply Tucker Decomposition**: Decompose the weight tensor into a core tensor and factor matrices.
3. **Reconstruct the Layer**: Create new convolutional layers using the decomposed tensors, which together approximate the original layer.

### Benefits
- **Parameter Reduction**: Tucker decomposition reduces the number of parameters in the convolutional layer.
- **Computational Efficiency**: The decomposed layers require fewer computations during the forward pass.
- **Scalability**: It can be applied to deeper layers of the network to optimize the entire model.
